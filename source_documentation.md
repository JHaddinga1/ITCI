## **Consumption Taxes**

* **`vat_rate`** OECD, "Value Added Tax/Goods and Services Tax (VAT/GST) (1976-2021): VAT/GST: standard and any reduced rates (2021)," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database/.

* **`vat_threshold`** OECD, "Value Added Tax/Goods and Services Tax (VAT/GST) (1976-2019): VAT/GST: Registration/Collection Thresholds (2021)," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database/.

* **`vat_base`**  The VAT Revenue Ratio was calculated using the following formula in line with the OECD's VRR calculations: VRR = VAT Revenue/[(Consumption - VAT revenue) x standard VAT rate]. Consumption = Final Consumption Expenditure (Heading P3) in the OECD national accounts. VAT rates used are standard rates applicable as of January 1 of each year. For Canada, the VRR calculation includes federal VAT only. For Australia, Greece, and Mexico there was no 2019 VAT revenue data available as of June 1, 2021, and thus their 2018 VAT Revenue Ratios were copied to 2019. The calculations are based on the following OECD source: OECD, "Consumption Tax Trends 2018," Dec. 5, 2018, https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/consumption-tax-trends-2018_ctt-2018-en#page92 (the relevant table can be downloaded using the following link: https://doi.org/10.1787/888933890122). The 2020 edition of the OECD publication "Consumption Tax Trends" includes OECD VRR numbers up to 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1787/888934220135); however, the downloadable data does not include the underlying calculations.
